# Project Documentation

## Project concept
Smart House Builder is designed to help a person find smart devices for his own home layout. We aimed to provide a friendly and intuitive interface for the application, while also giving the client the familiarity of the well known forum websites and the possibility of creating his own house layout in order to find products that suits it.
Our application desires to make it easy for the clients to search for smart devices and save them into a wishlist, as well as finding particular functionalities about them by navigating through the Forum.

## Project main functionalities
<br />

**Forum** <br />
Inspired by Filelist, our application provides a list of posts made by other users. You can like those posts, as well as report them. By your own preferences, you can sort these posts by most recent, popular and commented. Before clicking on a post that catches your attention, you can see the author, the date and the number of likes of comments. Later you can contribute to the forum by sharing your own experience by choosing your topic, writing down your description and category(Hardware, Quest, Review, Setup, Software). Smart House Builder has the feature of sharing via Twitter your own posts.

**Marketplace** <br />
By clicking on Marketplace, there will be shown a list of products and a set of options next to each product. The main features of Marketplace are to add to wishlist or check the description of our products. These devices are mainly scraped off Amazon and the info regarding these items are the price and an intuitive description of their properties.

**SHB** <br />
The most important and complex part of this project, Smart House Builder is the feature that the client uses in order to create the layout of his own house. Intuitively, the user can start adding objects from various categories such as devices, walls, windows, etc and describe where he wishes to place them in the desired setup.

**Account management and website information** <br />

Register interface is accessible from the login interface. Once logged in, by clicking your account user icon, you can either Manage your account or logout.  <br />
<br />
